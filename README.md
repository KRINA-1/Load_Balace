# Load-Balancer-Visulization
Load Balancer Visulization
This project demonstrates various load balancing algorithms using simulation. The goal is to help students and developers understand the functioning of load balancing techniques in a system design context.

Introduction
Load balancing is a critical concept in system design for distributing client requests or network traffic across multiple servers. This ensures no single server is overwhelmed, improving overall system performance and reliability.

This project visualizes four common load balancing algorithms:

Round Robin Algorithm
Weighted Round Robin Algorithm
Least Connections Algorithm
Hash-Based Algorithm
